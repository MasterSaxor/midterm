[Verse 1]
I'm strong, I'm sure
I'm in control, a lady with a plan
Believing that life is a neat little package I hold in my hand
I've got it together
They call me the girl who knows just what to say and do
Still, I fumble and fall
Run into the wall 'cause when it comes to you

[Chorus]
I'm just another woman in love
A kid out of school
A fire out of control
Just another fool

You touch me and I'm weak
I'm a feather in the wind
And I can't wait to feel you touching me again
With you, I'm just another woman
Just another woman in love
